# (delete or comment me out)
  Today's progress:Learnt the introductory part of SpringBoot framework,
                  and did research on why it was invented
  
Thoughts:It is a totally new concept but i am sure i will grasp the concepts with time

# Day1 of 99:March 12,2024
  Todays progres: I managed to generate a java project using the framework ,i learnt about the different
                 dependencies within the framework one can add to their project depending on what is needed.

                 
  Thoughts: This was an amazing experience as the whole project is actually structured to what you need.
              Eager to learn more!!

  # Day 11 of 99:March 22nd ,2024

  Today's progress : Implemented the User repository interface (UserRepository) that extends JpaRepository<User, and

Thoughts: Running my application in the localhost server is yet an issue for me .. still have to learn the steps clearly to rid me of 
the same issue

# Day 13 of 99: March 24th,2024

Today's progress: I began working on the Datastructures and algorithms in Java and began with the implementation of arrays as a data structure

Thought: Not a new concept but it's implementation in java and code form is really important.
