  Todays progres: I managed to generate a java project using the framework ,i learnt about the different
                 dependencies within the framework one can add to their project depending on what is needed.

                 
  Thoughts: This was an amazing experience as the whole project is actually structured to what you need.
              Eager to learn more!!
